    <u>O Captain! My Captain!</u>
    <br>
    by Walt Whitman
    <br>
    <br>
    O CAPTAIN! my Captain! our fearful trip is done; 
    <br>
    The ship has weather'd every rack, the prize we sought is won; 
    <br>
    The port is near, the bells I hear, the people all exulting, 
    <br>
    While follow eyes the steady keel, the vessel grim and daring: 
    <br>
    But O heart! heart! heart!
    <br>
    O the bleeding drops of red, 
    <br>
    Where on the deck my Captain lies, 
    <br>
    Fallen cold and dead. 
    <br>
    <br>
    O Captain! my Captain! rise up and hear the bells; 
    <br>
    Rise up-for you the flag is flung-for you the bugle trills;
    <br>
    For you bouquets and ribbon'd wreaths-for you the shores a-crowding; 
    <br>
    For you they call, the swaying mass, their eager faces turning; 
    <br>
    Here Captain! dear father! 
    <br>
    This arm beneath your head; 
    <br>
    It is some dream that on the deck,
    <br>
    You've fallen cold and dead. 
    <br>
    <br>
    My Captain does not answer, his lips are pale and still; 
    <br>
    My father does not feel my arm, he has no pulse nor will; 
    <br>
    The ship is anchor'd safe and sound, its voyage closed and done; 
    <br>
    From fearful trip, the victor ship, comes in with object won;
    <br>
    Exult, O shores, and ring, O bells! 
    <br>
    But I, with mournful tread, 
    <br>
    Walk the deck my Captain lies, 
    <br>
    Fallen cold and dead.
